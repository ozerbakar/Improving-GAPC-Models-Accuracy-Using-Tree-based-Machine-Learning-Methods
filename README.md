# Improved-GAPC-Models-Using-Tree-based-Machine-Learning-Models
This repository includes the R codes of the paper: "Can Tree-based Machine Learning Methods Improve GAPC Models' Forecasting Accuracy?

The R codes are deliberatively written in the simplest way that everyone can understand step-by-step and easily apply to their own research. 
** This code reproduces the results and graphs for Denmark, when another country is used; change the word DNK to SWE in the scripts.

Note that before applying the ML integrated model, the following scripts below must be run in sequence:
1. ReadData_LoadPackages
2. Fitting_Forecasting_Mort.Model
3. ML-Data_Preperation
